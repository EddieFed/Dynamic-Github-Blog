Index.js will search the db.json for a list of all posts and their topics. At the same time, each post will be it's own independent page.

db.json will be organized as follows

[
    ["title", "Date string", ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"]],
    ["title2", "Date string2", ["topic4", "topic2", "topic5"]]
]
