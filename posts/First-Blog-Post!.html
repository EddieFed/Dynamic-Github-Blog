        <div class="body"><h4>** Note: This will be a super long post</h4><p><strong>So..</strong> I finally decided to get this blog up and running!<br />I'll mostly be using this as a sort <em>diary/blog/devlog</em>.<br />Mostly all three and more at once to be honest...<br /><br />A couple things for future me first though:</p><ul><li>If you ever dare put any excessive CSS on this page I'll kill future me...</li><li>Anime is good, don't become like Tommy.</li><li>You better finish DoodleDoodleDrawDraw...</li><li>And also the free-games-alert project.</li></ul><p>I thought I'd also include a list of crap happening in the world right now so I can look back</p><ul><li>George Floyd protests are happening everywhere. The world is just crazy right now.</li><li>The US is a madhouse, honestly, the political divide here is ridiculous. Honestly it's just saddening.</li><li>COVID-19 is still everywhere in the country.</li></ul><p>I think I'm gonna start posting <em>movie/tv/anime</em> reviews for the shows I watch.<br />Recently I finished <em>Fruits Basket</em> and I started recently <em>Oreimo</em> I'll write about those soon!<br /><br />Man this is such a random post. I'm just glad I got this blog thingy working!!<br />Okay BYE!!!<br /><br /><img src="https://www.eddiefed.com/megumin/1.gif" width="50" />&nbsp;<tt>- Eddie</tt></p>        </div>
