        <div class="body"><p>So I started writing my post about my trip from Europe in 2019.<br />I'm doing it over the course of a couple days and writing it the style of a journal.<br />It's actually really soothing to look over pictures and reflect on them.<br />Hopefully I'll have it done soon!<br /><br />In other news, I bought my friends Anthony and myself the season pass for Destiny 2 (Season of the Arrivals).<br />Hopefully it's fun. So far we completed the base quest and played a bit just for fun today.<br />I'm really thankful I got my friends to play games with in Quarantine, seriously, I'd be losing my mind if I didn't<br /><br /><br />Anyways, Here's a fun song!<br /><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sLp8LDylshU" width="400" height="230" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
