        <div class="body"><p>Currently as I'm writing this it's <strong>5:18am</strong> but I feel like i need to write something. <br />Even though this blog will likely never be read by anyone, which is fine, it's nice to write thoughts somewhere...<br /><br />Anyways, I've been doing a lot of reflections the past couple days since I tend to be staying up super late (like right now, 5am...). <br />So I thought it would be a cool idea to start making a list of things I'd like to do in the future. <br />And the list I'll have here is going to be a live list on Github (yeah I know, kinda funny huh) <s>because that way I can embed it</s> Actually never mind, I cant...<br /><br />It's going to be dreams I have, dreams I might never get to live or achieve, but still, I'd love to at least try, that way I can experience life to the fullest.<br /><a href="https://gist.github.com/EddieFed/da1ebc2b64c363e2e73f8b692d8abca6#file-bucketlist">Heres the list! --- https://gist.github.com/EddieFed/da1ebc2b64c363e2e73f8b692d8abca6#file-bucketlist</a><br /><br />Anyways...<br /> I want my next post to be a reflection on my trip to Europe last year before school.<br /> I had meant to write about it a long time ago but I keep putting it off for some reason.<br /> I miss the experience and making this bucket list and thinking of traveling really brings back those memories...<br /> Hopefully I'll write the post tomorrow (today tomorrow, same thing I guess it's <strong>6:25am</strong>). <br /><br />So yeah, I want to write about my trip, but I got a couple other ideas to write about. Here's a list of ideas I have to write about</p><ul><li>The trip to Europe (Like I said above)</li><li>My experience with covid-19 so far</li><li>My opinions on the world's political polarization</li><li>My future, college, career, etc...</li><li>Anime reviews like I said last post</li></ul><p><br />Hopefully I can get into a habit of posting daily so it becomes a routine!</p><p>(Wow I got so distracted trying to get the Github embed to work it took an hour to write this post ;-;)<br />- Eddie</p>
