        <div class="body"><p>So I actually writer this yesterday night at 5am, I forgot to post it and I had it saved so cool.<br />Begin random boring rant from an unintelligent teenager:<br /><br />Hi this is a rant post just fyi :/<br /><br />So the past couple days I've realized I'm pretty horrible at being consistent with anything.<br />I've been sleeping at 5-7am and waking up at 2-4pm or not even sleeping at all for a day.<br /><br />That got me thinking. It's been exactly 100 days since I've been home in quarantine for COVID-19.<br />Which is both kind of crazy since my family's quarantine means literally we haven't gone out anywhere unless it's an essential.<br />At the same time, I've been hearing about friends out having a going away party for a friend leaving for the Navy.<br />For the first 2 months I gotta say, quarantine was wonderful, seriously, I felt so free.<br /><br />Having had gotten out of a decently long relationship a couple months prior that really hit me hard.<br />I felt like I was free from the social pressures of school. After online classes and AP tests ended, I basically dedicated a good amount of time to playing video games.<br />Mostly Destiny 1 and 2. Which I mean they're super fun, but recently I noticed within myself I've been pushing a lot of other things aside for playing games.<br /><br />At the same time as all that I have college coming up.<br />With COVID-19 college is gonna be so weird. I barely have any idea about how housings gonna work, let alone classes.<br /><br />Along with college creeping up, a decent loss of motivation which is leading me to video games, a lot of my old friends seem to have left me in various ways<br />At least it feels like it. Throughout quarantine a couple people have asked me early on when things started opening to hang out.After saying no to them, it seems nobody wants to talk to me.<br />It's kinda hard considering I liked to talk to everyone. There's few people I enjoy playing games with, and I'm lucky to have them, but most people I only like talking in person.<br />(In general I'm not a gamer, so that's why there's only a couple people I like gaming with, that probably came off as pretty pretentious though).<br /><br />I really don't know what to do, every night.<br />I stay up until 6am thinking about how I feel lonely, I wake up at 2pm to play games for a couple hours, eat dinner, help my family with sorting stuff in the house for donating<br />(quarantine got us to start some spring cleaning and it's been going on forever), and sleep. It's an endless cycle that isn't gonna end any time soon.</p<p>I've been trying to brainstorm things to get me into a good routine. A couple of my ideas are:</p><ul><li>Sleeping schedule midnight -7:30am.</li><li>Start limiting video games to 7:30am-noon. Occasionally other times but mostly around that time. I would like to work on projects and help\naround the house without being distracted by games.</li><li>Start a regular work out routine where I run right when I wake up, then work out and shower after. Setting up my day good.</li></ul><p>They're weird goals, but I need some consistency in my life now.<br />At first inconsistently feels truly liberating until it becomes uncontrollable.<br />Then it becomes destructive, and that's where I'm at right now.<br />So in order to combat the growing depressiveness in my mood and everyday life I think I'll start doing that.<br /><br />If you read this, you're super weird, just sayin'. But thanks for reading if you did &lt;3<br /><br />Oh yeah... I used to have Spotify Premium since I worked at Starbucks, now that I don't, it sucks. Just sayin'.</p>
