            <div class="body">So yesterday and today, I decided to remake the backed for this crappy blog.<br>
Initially I made it so that there was a single file that would contain every single post.<br><br>
It worked, but in practice, it was terrible. Everytime you loaded the home page or a blog page you were downloading the entire website worth of posts...<br>

Now the site has a <tt>/posts</tt> folder and a database json file that keeps track of all the topics for posts, as well as just the titles and dates of them.<br><br>

I was able to make the site dynamically generate a new page via the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a>. It's kinda fun to mess around with.<br>
Although there really is no benefit to doing this for a blog, it's been fun and I think well worth it because I got to toy with a silly concept.<br>
Ideally, as I've said before in other posts, I'd like to continue posting here even though probably nobody will read it. But eh.<br><br>

I think I'll head to sleep now so I can wake up early tomorrow. I gotta start waking up earlier, college is coming soon!<br>
