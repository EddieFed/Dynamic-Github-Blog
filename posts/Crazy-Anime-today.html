        <div class="body"><p>I almost forgot to post today! Already can't even go two days straight wow...<br /><br />Anyway. I did watch a couple anime movies today; I watched "Redline" and "Perfect Blue".<br />Both of them were pretty amazing in their own ways.<br /><br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redline_(2009_film)">Redline</a> was a futuristic kind of punk anime about racing, very much like speed racer but in space. It had an awesome style and very well written with pretty great music.<br /><br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Blue">Perfect Blue</a> was basically the exact opposite side of the genre spectrum. <br />It was a thriller, psychological horror movie, about a girl who loses touch between her own personality and the personality that people expect from her; all while being stalked and targeted throughout the movie.<br />It was honestly a really jarring film to watch. It's scary in the sense of how heavily people invest their lives into creating an online persona of themselves...<br />Here's a video I found that talked more in depth about it and made me realize what that really means nowadays versus when the movie was made.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJmK5SOeQBc">Why Perfect Blue is Terrifying - Super Eyepatch Wolf</a><br /><br />Also today I spent a lot of time on Minecraft with my friends, I'm in the middle of building a massive tree house since supposedly in the "master builder"<br />I'm not sure about that statement, but I'll take it.<br />We also watched that movie Redline together over a PS4 party chat and all watching it on our own phones at the same time so we can talk together, I really hope we do that again.<br />Being stuck in quarantine from covid-19, that kind of think is really therapeutic...<br /><br />Anyway, bye bye! <br />&nbsp;- Eddie &lt;3</p>
