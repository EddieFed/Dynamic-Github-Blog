            <div class="body"><i>So covid hasn't ended, nor will it probably for a long long while.<br>
Also, I haven't posted here in a really really long time.</i><br><br>
So I thought I might as well post my experience at college and living alone during covid.<br><br>
First off, I go to <i>UIC</i>, and as a CS major, all of my classes are 100% online.<br>
It's not bad at all, but it is very weird being on campus during a "global pandemic",
Pretty much everywhere I go is a ghost town on campus. Often I'll go around campus playing Pokemon Go, but unless I go into the city or an actual neighborhood, being in a city of near 3 million people literally feels like a ghost town here. Luckily I've gotten accustomed to taking the train back home and I occasionally visit some friends when I can. So I guess, I'm not completely alone in this ghostly atmosphere all the time.<br><br>
Second, I'm not trapped in a vicious cycle of mental torment I brought upon myself, I sleep, do homework, attend lectures, and entertain myself with video games, all within a dorm. I wish I were able to go to the student rec center, lecture halls, libraries, etc... but they're all closed due to covid, an understandable reaction, yet an unbelievably disappointing and aggravating one. It recently came to my attention that from covid, we've all essentially set a course towards pure misery. Just watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1mTELoj6o">CGP Grey's video</a> about it to know what I mean. It's basically just self-destructive behavior that's now being labeled "social distancing". While it's important to avoid <i>close and prolonged</i> exposure from those who are elderly, vulnerable, and simply wish for distance; Isolating ourselves completely from the outside world is incredibly destructive, mentally, physically, and emotionally. So I guess I'll need to work on more of a routine for myself to combat this. Like getting out and going for a run or maybe just things other than <b>just</b> video games and studying nonstop.<br><br>
I don't know... It's been an experience being on campus for school, while <b><i>literally</i></b> never attending class in person.<br>
Since there's no real hoping for covid to disappear any time in the next year or two, I guess my goal for the coming years is to fix my life up so I'm not laying on my butt doing nothing anymore.<br><br>
